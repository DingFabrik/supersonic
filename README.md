About

An experiment in making a music live-coding tool in Ruby.

Uhm, don't expect anything! We're just getting the things together. It's even not alpha right at the moment... 

You can take a look at the dev-board at Trello! Feel free to submit your feature-requests or bugs...

Some very first documentation:

SuperSonic currently tries to connect to a pure-data patch, listening to TCP-Socket (seq16.pd).

Inspect supersonic.rb and especially "seq16" for stuff to do.

Type "man" for some help on the commands

Note: Midi is not really used right at the moment...

```
midiout - Select MIDI-Output-Device

midiin - Select MIDI-Input-Device

```
