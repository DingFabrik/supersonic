SuperSonic
==========

About 
-----

An experiment in making a music live-coding tool in Ruby.

Status
------

Uhm, don't expect anything! We're just getting the things together. It's even not alpha right at the moment... 

Doku
----

Some very first documentation:

SuperSonic currently tries to connect to a pure-data patch, listening to TCP-Socket.

Inspect supersonic.rb and especially "seq16" for stuff to do.

Note: Midi is not really used right at the moment...

```
midiout - Select MIDI-Output-Device

midiin - Select MIDI-Input-Device

```
